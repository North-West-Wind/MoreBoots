# MoreBoots
Adds more boots to your Minecraft game!  
Fabric version available [here](https://github.com/North-West-Wind/MoreBoots-Fabric)!  
To download, you can either download it from:
- [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/moreboots)
- [GitHub](https://github.com/North-West-Wind/MoreBoots/releases/latest) (This is no longer updated after version 3.0.0)

## Feature
(Boots of course)  
This mod includes 48 pair of boots. Each of them gives you a different ability.  
Let's mention some of my favourites (as of current version):
- Plumber Boots: The boots of that famous plumber from Nintendo. You can stomp on enemies!
- Vanishing Boots: With it equipped, you can go through a lot of non-solid blocks, such as doors, glass and carpets!
- Glass Boots: It doesn't do anything itself, but you can put it in a brewing stand to get whatever effect you want!

And here are Zinaida7224's favourites (as of current version):
- Rainbow Socks: Features from the Youtuber Socksfor1, jumps very high the longer you sneak on the ground!
- Gliders: They allow you to glide!
- Flying Boots: Allows you to fly just like in Creative mode!

There is also a Forge-only feature, which is the Boot Recycler.  
The recycler allows you to turn boots into energy. It even works with boots from other mods!  
Energy generated (not for boots from this mod) can be calculated as follow:  
Energy = (maxDurability ^ 2) / 2 + (armor + toughness) ^ 4 + (enchantability + enchantments) ^ 4

## Updates
I originally planned to update this mod on a weekly basis, but time is becoming more scarce for me. I cannot make as much updates as before.

If you want a pair of boots of your dream to appear in the mod, please let me know. You can do that by creating an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/North-West-Wind/MoreBoots), or message me on Discord (NorthWestWind#1885). You may also make suggestions on the [MoreBoots Discord](https://discord.gg/UFEMhuY9xT)!

You can help out by expanding a [wiki](https://moreboots.fandom.com) on Fandom, so it can be seen be many people!

These updates are being planned:
- Content Update 2 (Coming Soon!)
- Heroic Update (Coming Soon!)
